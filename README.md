# this-isnt-a-gd-level
This Isn't a GD Level is an experimental physics demo I created for a challenge. Development is still ongoing as of 21/12/2025!

The game shouldn't be took seriously. This is a joke game!
This game is inspired by Geometry Dash.
Music belongs to Camellia
You play as an Extreme Demon ball. You can use WASD to navigate and your objective is to roll down a slope and eliminate as many cubes as you can.
